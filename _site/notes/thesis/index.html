<p>This was my undergraduate thesis. Ostensibly, it is an exposition on Kodaira’s work on classifying singular fibers of elliptic surfaces over \(\mathbb C\). In practice though, it’s more of an introduction to 2-dimensional complex geometry w/ Kodaira’s working serving as a particular application of the general theory.</p>
