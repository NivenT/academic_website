<p>This is an exposition on the sections of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0672">this paper</a> which reprove Davenport-Heilbronnâ€™s results on counting cubic number fields. Honestly, these notes ended up being little more than a slightly expanded version of the relevant sections of that paper, where I tried to give a few more details in places where the paper initially confused me. If you are going to look at these notes, probably the best thing to do is just read the (relevant sections of) the Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman paper, and then look at these notes whenever you would like to see more of the steps involved in some calculation.</p>
