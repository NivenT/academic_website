This is a learning seminar on the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and on modularity of elliptic curves. The main goal is to hopefully address the question, "How on Earth does one prove that some representation is modular?" Our main source will be [the big book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1974-3) "Modular Forms and Fermat's Last Theorem'' edited by Cornell, Silverman, and Stevens, but we will use other sources as well (see below).

# Schedule 
Each meeting will have a specified topic and will start with someone giving a short (say, 20--40 minutes) talk/summary. Afterwards, we will proceed with an informal discussion to try to work out each others confusions. Speakers are encouraged to write notes, and participants are encoraged to look at the reference(s) ahead of each meeting.

<b>Meeting time: TBD (Will fix a regular time once the semester starts)</b>
