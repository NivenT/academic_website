Fix a field $F$. Here are three schemes which could all be described colloquially as "$$\P^1$$, but with multiplicity $$2$$." Which, if any, among them are isomorphic as $$F$$-schemes?

* The subscheme $$X_1:=\{Y^2 = 0\}\subset\P^2_F$$. In other words, $$X_1=\Proj F[X,Y,Z]/(Y^2)$$, where $$X,Y,Z$$ are all in degree $$1$$.
* The subscheme $$X_2:=\{Y^2 = 0\}\subset\P(1,2,1)_F$$. In other words, $$X_2=\Proj F[X,Y,Z]/(Y^2)$$, where $$X,Z$$ are in degree $$1$$, but $$Y$$ is in degree $$2$$.
* $$X_3:=\P^1_{F[\eps]/(\eps)^2}$$, but viewed as an $$F$$-scheme.
