Let $$B/\F_q$$ be a smooth, proper, geometrically integral curve with functionf field $$K:=\F_q(B)$$. Let $$E/K$$ be an elliptic curve. Then, it has some (minimal) Weierstrass model $$W/B$$ sitting inside of some $$\P^2$$-bundle over $$B$$. Most of the time this $$W$$ can be described as the vanishing locus of some global equation

$$W:Y^2Z + a_1XYZ + a_3YZ = X^3 + a_2X^2Z + a_4XZ^2 + a_6Z^3$$

inside $$\P(\msO_B\oplus\inv[2]\msL\oplus\inv[3]\msL)$$, where $$\msL\in\Pic(B)$$ is the Hodge bundle of $$W$$ (i.e. the pullback of the relative dualizing sheaf $$\omega_{W/B}$$ along the identity section $$B\to W$$). Above, $$a_i\in\hom^0(B,\msL^i)$$.

Finally, the question: can you write down an example of an elliptic curve which does *not* have a Weierstrass model cut out by a global equation like this? (Hint: you'll need $$\Char K=2$$).
