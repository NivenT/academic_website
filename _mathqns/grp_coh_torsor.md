Prove or disprove the following. Let $$G$$ be a group and let $$M$$ be a (not necessarily abelian) group with $$G$$-action (by group homomorphisms). Then, the cohomology set $$H^1(G,M)$$ is in bijection with the set of (isomorphism classes) of $$G$$-sets $$X$$ with a compatible, simply transitive $$M$$-action. The "compatibility" condition referred to in the previous sentence is that

$$g\cdot(m\cdot x)=(g\cdot m)\cdot(g\cdot x)$$

for any $$g\in G, m\in M,$$ and $$x\in X$$.
