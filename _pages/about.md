I am a math grad student at MIT working with [Bjorn Poonen](https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/) and broadly interested in arithmetic geometry and especially in points on varieties. Recently, I have most actively thinking about Brauer groups of stacky curves, but I have also studied some "bad characteristic" statistics of ranks of elliptic curves and have some finiteness results for integral points on high dimensional varieites. 

You can find more information about my research in my [cv]({{ '/assets/pdf/cv.pdf' | relative_url}}) or under the "news" header below.

<b>I am currently on the job market and am very happy to come talk about my work!</b>

Fun fact: if you press the moon/sun in the top right, you can switch between light/dark themes for this site.

    There are many hidden secrets on this site. Try and find them all (seems some of them are less hidden on mobile...).
