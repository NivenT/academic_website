Starting Fall 2025, I am a BP and NSF postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, mentored by [Melanie Matchett Wood](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mmwood/). I completed by PhD at MIT, advised by [Bjorn Poonen](https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/). 

I am broadly interested in arithmetic geometry, arithmetic statistics, and especially in points on varieties. I generally like applying algebro-geometric arguments and cohomology computations in the service of proving finiteness results. See the [research]({{ '/research' | relative_url}}) tab for more on my work.

You can find more information about me and my work in my [cv]({{ '/assets/pdf/cv.pdf' | relative_url}}) or under the "news" header below.
