I am a math grad student at MIT working with [Bjorn Poonen](https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/) and broadly interested in arithmetic geometry and especially in points on varieties. I generally like applying algebro-geometric arguments and cohomology computations in the service of proving finiteness results. I have work on Brauer groups of stacky curves, "bad characteristic" statistics of ranks of elliptic curves, and integral points on high dimensional varieties.

You can find more information about my research in my [cv]({{ '/assets/pdf/cv.pdf' | relative_url}}) or under the "news" header below.

Fun fact: if you press the moon/sun in the top right, you can switch between light/dark themes for this site.

    There are many hidden secrets on this site. Try and find them all (seems some of them are less hidden on mobile...).
