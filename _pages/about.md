I am a math grad student at MIT, broadly interested in arithmetic geometry and especially in points on varieties. My advisor is [Bjorn Poonen](https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/). 

Recently, I have most actively thinking about Brauer groups of stacky curves, but you can find more information on my research in my [cv]({{ '/assets/pdf/cv.pdf' | relative_url}}) (and probably also under the "news" header below).

<b>I am currently on the job market and am very happy to come talk about my work!</b>

Fun fact: if you press the moon/sun in the top right, you can switch between light/dark themes for this site.

    There are many hidden secrets on this site. Try and find them all (seems some of them are less hidden on mobile...).
