Hopefully you can't see this, but if you can: here's some stuff from me trying to figure out how to get this website up and running...<br>
{{ "/notes/" | relative_url }} {{ site.baseurl }} {{ site.url }} {{ "/notes/" | absolute_url }}

I'm a math grad student at MIT, interested broadly in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.

You can find my cv [here](.), once I make an up to date one.

Fun fact: if you press the moon/sun in the top right, you can switch between light/dark themes for this site.

    There are many hidden secrets on this site. Try and find them all.
