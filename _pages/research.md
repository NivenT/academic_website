So far, I have mostly worked on projects related to, either directly or indirectly, points on varieties. But I have broader interests in most things that fall under arithmetic/algebraic geometry. 

If you want more details on the nature of my research, I wrote many statements describing my work in grad school when I was applying for postdocs. These include this [(long) research statement](/assets/pdf/Research_Statement_Long.pdf) aimed at mathematicians as well as this [(much shorter) statement](/assets/pdf/Miller_Statement.pdf) aimed at a general scientific audience. Finally, one can see below for a list of my papers (publications + preprints).
