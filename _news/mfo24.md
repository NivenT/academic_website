I attended Oberwolfach's [Explicit Methods in Number Theory](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2436/www_view) workshop, where I gave a talk about some of my recent, ongoing work computing Brauer groups of stacky curves. In particular, I discussed a computation of the Brauer group of a tame stacky curve over an algebraically closed field (unlike in the scheme case, these are often nonzero).
