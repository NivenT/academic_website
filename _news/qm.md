I spoke at the [Qu√©bec-Maine Number Theory Conference](https://maine-quebec.mat.ulaval.ca/24/qm24.html) on my recent work on Brauer groups of stacky curves. Later that week, I posted [the paper containing this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06217) to arxiv. Later in the month, I spoke about it again at the [AMS's Fall Western Sectional Meeting](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2304_program.html) at UC Riverside and then at Rice's algebraic geometry and number theory seminar.
