I posted a [new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08493) on arxiv. It is about bounding the average size of $$2$$-Selmer groups of elliptic curves $$E$$ over characteristic $$2$$ function fields. One aesthetically pleasing consequence of this work is that it completes the proof that the average rank of elliptic curves over $$K$$ is finite, for any global field $$K$$.
