I posted a [new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08493) on arxiv. It is about bounding the average size of $$2$$-Selmer groups of elliptic curves $$E$$ over characteristic $$2$$ function fields. It also produces some new bounds on $$\dim_{\F_2}\Sel_2(E/K)$$ when $$\Char K=2$$ (and $$K$$ is a global function field).
